                        Tham Chang Cave is spread over 2 levels with several separate chambers. It takes about 20
                        minutes to walk through the whole cave complex. The cave is fairly well lit and there are stairs
                        with rails inside. It’s not dangerous and suitable for children over 8 years old.Tham Chang Cave
                        is well worth visiting although there are better caves around Vang Vieng, but further away from
                        the town centre. The inside of cave is noticeably cooler than the outside and a visit combining
                        the cave with the blue lagoon and the viewpoint is a good way to spend a few hours.
